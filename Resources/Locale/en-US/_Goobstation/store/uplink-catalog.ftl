uplink-hardsuit-cybersun-dreadnought-desc = An insanely tough combat hardsuit utilizing hyper-bluespace enhanced plasteel to make an almost impenetrable wall out of the wearer.

The syndicate sends their regards.

uplink-hardsuit-cybersun-stealth-desc = Reversed engineered from Spider Clan technology, this hardsuit has stealth plating in it for those special ops. Slightly slower and less armor than the default hardsuits.
