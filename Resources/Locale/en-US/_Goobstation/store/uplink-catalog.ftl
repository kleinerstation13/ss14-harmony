uplink-hardsuit-cybersun-dreadnought-name = Cybersun Dreadnought suit
uplink-hardsuit-cybersun-dreadnought-desc = An insanely tough combat hardsuit utilizing hyper-bluespace enhanced plasteel to make an almost impenetrable wall out of the wearer. However, only the absolutely insane syndicate followers will put this on. Because of its weight, it must be tightened very hard, to the point of impaling the user and being unable to be taken off without completely ripping off their skin. The syndicate sends their regards.
