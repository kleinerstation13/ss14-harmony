  name: tactical voidsuit
  suffix: Harmony
  description: A flexible voidsuit produced by a subsidiary of Cybersun Industries. It has been lined with a carbon composite to protect against conventional ranged weaponry. The fragile ceramic plating combined with some design compromises to allow for EVA capability have lead to decreased effectiveness against blunt weapons.
