  suffix: Harmony
  description: A classic intermediate cartridge used by many combat rifles and LMGs. Contains a plasteel core with a reinforced plasma tip, improving the penetration capability of the cartridge exponentially. Damage against unarmored opponents leaves something to be desired, though.
