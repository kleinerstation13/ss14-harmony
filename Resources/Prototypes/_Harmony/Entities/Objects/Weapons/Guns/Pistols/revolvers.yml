  description: A semi-automatic handcannon produced by Waffle Corp in prohibitively low numbers. It has noticeably been fitted with a reciever that allows it to fire .60 ammunition. The designers weren't able to get rid of the wrist-shattering recoil, though some speculate it's an intended feature.
